# Food Hub Data Analysis Project

## Description
This project was completed as part of the **Post Graduate Program in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning: Business Applications** offered by **Great Learning** in partnership with the **University of Texas at Austin**. The project was delivered in **November 2023** and focuses on performing data analysis to provide actionable insights for a food aggregator company.

The goal of this project is to analyze customer orders data and answer key business questions, helping the company improve its operations and strategy.

## Problem Statement
The food aggregator company has collected data on various orders made by registered customers on their online platform. As a **Data Scientist**, you are tasked with analyzing this data to derive insights that will help improve the companyâ€™s business. Specifically, the project involves answering key questions posed by the Data Science team, with the objective of optimizing the company's operations and customer satisfaction.

## Repository Contents
This repository contains three key files:
- **FoodHub_Project.ipynb**: This is the Jupyter Notebook that contains the Python code used for data analysis. It includes all the steps and visualizations needed to derive insights from the data.
- **FoodHub_Data.csv**: This is the dataset in CSV format that was imported into the notebook for analysis.
- **index.html** This is the HTML file to browese the full project.

## Skills and Tools
The following skills and tools were applied during the project:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted using Python to explore, visualize, and derive insights from the data. This included:
  - **Variable Identification**
  - **Univariate Analysis** (analyzing individual variables)
  - **Bivariate Analysis** (analyzing relationships between two variables)
- **Python**: Utilized for writing code and performing data analysis, specifically using libraries like **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

## Key Insights and Deliverables
Through this project, the following were achieved:
- Identification of **patterns in customer orders**.
- Insights into **customer behavior, order trends**, and **possible areas for business improvement**.
- **Visualizations** to communicate findings effectively to stakeholders.
